const accountID = 14555 //it is just a number so no double qoutes
let accountEmail = "neha@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345" //here the 12345 is a number but it is a string that's why it is in double qoutes because passwords can be alphanumeric/numeric/alphbets so
accountCity = "Jaipur" 
// let's try change everything bcoz const stays same var changes

accountID = 2
console.log(accountID);
